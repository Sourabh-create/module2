                <h2>Take Off</h2>
                <p>
                    Takeoff is the phase of flight in which an aircraft goes through a transition from moving along the ground (taxiing) to flying in the air, usually starting on a runway. Usually the engines are run at full power during takeoff. Following the taxi motion, the aircraft stops at the starting line of the runway. Before takeoff, the engines, particularly piston engines, are routinely run up at high power to check for engine-related problems. This makes a consid- erable noise. When the pilot releases the brakes, the aircraft starts accelerating rapidly until the necessary speed for take-off is achieved.

                <h2>Cruise</h2>
                <p>
					Cruise is the level portion of aircraft travel where flight is most fuel efficient. It occurs between ascent and descent phases and is usually the majority of a journey. Technically, cruising consists of heading (direction of flight) changes only at a constant airspeed and altitude. It ends as the aircraft approaches the destination where the descent phase of flight commences in preparation for landing.                </p>

                <h2>Landing</h2>
                <p>
                    Landing is the last part of a flight, where the aircraft returns to the ground. Aircraft usually land at an airport on a firm runway, generally constructed of asphalt concrete, concrete, gravel or grass. To land, the airspeed and the rate of descent are reduced to where the object descends at a slow enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down. Landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending to the runway. This speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust and/or inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps, landing gear or speed brakes. As the plane approaches the ground, the pilot will execute a flare (roundout) to induce a gentle landing. Although the pilots are trained to perform the landing operation, there are “Instrument Landing Systems” in most of the airports to help pilots land the aircrafts.
